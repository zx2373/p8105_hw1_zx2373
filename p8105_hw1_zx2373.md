\#Problem 1

\###Description of data

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

-   This is a tibble data frame about penguins with names of variables:
    species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm,
    body_mass_g, sex, year.
-   The bill length has a range of 32.1, 59.6 and a mean of 43.9219298
    mm.
-   The bill depth has a range of 13.1, 21.5 and a mean of 17.1511696
    mm.
-   The flipper length has a range of 172, 231.
-   The body mass has a range of 2700, 6300 and a mean of 4201.754386 g.
-   There are 344 rows and 8 columns in the dataset.
-   The mean flipper length is 200.9152047 mm after removing all missing
    data in the flipper length column.

\###Scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) + geom_point(aes(color = species))
```

```

\#Problem 2

\###Create a data frame

``` r
hw1_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
  vec_char = rep(c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"), length.out = 10),
  vec_factor = factor(rep(c("high","middle","low"), length.out = 10))
  )
```

\###Mean of variable

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df,vec_numeric))
```

    ## [1] 0.0730009

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df,vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df,vec_char))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df,vec_factor))
```

    ## [1] NA

-   When I try to take the means of character vector and factor vector,
    it returns NAs because argument is not numeric or logical.

\###Convert logical, character and factor vectors into numbers

``` r
x = as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, vec_logical))
y = as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
z = as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor))
```

\*\*After converting, the logical vector remains the same, which is
“True = 1\*” and “False = 0”.** **The factor vector generates the
numerical mean. But the character variable cannot be converted into
numbers and are left as NA.\*\*
